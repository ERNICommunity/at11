Installation instructions

This is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). powered application, so first you need to have Node.js up and running. If you dont know how to do it [start here](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation).

1. Get the sources from [here](https://github.com/jakub-sturc/at11) and save them locally. You can also clone the repository if you wish. If you want to contribute feel free to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), make improvements and create pull requests.
2. Change into directory with sources `cd path/to/sources`.
3. Execute `npm install`. This might take a minute as all required dependecies must be downloaded.
4. After successful installation execute `node app`. This should prompt message `Listening on port 54321.` and hang.
5. Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:54321](http://localhost:54321) and you should see today's menus.
